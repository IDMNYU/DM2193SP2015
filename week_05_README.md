## Week 5

    Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.
        — Confucious

### In-Class Tuesday
* Single Page Recipe Site
    * Start fresh with a copy of my markup, [get it here](https://github.com/IDMNYU/DM2193FA2014/raw/master/week_04/johnny/recipe_app.zip)
    * Exact the contents and *copy* into a folder in your `week_04/your_name` directory
    * Make an initial commit to GitHub
      * "My initial commit for single page recipe site"
      * Sync with Github
    * Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the markup and class names
      * Styling things goes faster when you know how the markup is put together!
    * We are going to style the recipes to look like cards and you can flip between them
    * This will be the basis of our introduction to Javascript for next class so be sharp!
    * Open up the empty stylesheet and take it away!

### In-Class Thursday
* Show & Tell
* Finish up the Single Page Recipe Site
  * There's still a few good pieces of CSS that we should apply based on last Thursday's class and where we left off on Tuesday.
  * We're going to spend half the class wrapping this up so we have a good finished example of the techniques in this exercise.


### Q + A
*10min at the end of class for any unanswers questions*

### Reading Assignment
* [Classical Inheritance in JavaScript](http://javascript.crockford.com/inheritance.html)

### Homework
* Make sure your single-page version of the recipe site is in a healthy state for Thursday.
